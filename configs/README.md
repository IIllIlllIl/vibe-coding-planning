# Config Guide

The top level contains only active configs and one representative executable
config for each paused workflow. Date-specific runs, smoke tests, retries, and
superseded variants live under `archive/` and remain available for provenance.

## Active Online GEPA

| Config | Runtime | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `gepa_online_planning_hpc.yaml` | ULHPC Apptainer | Standard formal configuration over the 384/98 split. Trace workers add a repo-grounded reviewer in the matching benchmark SIF, then controller-side synthesis proposes rules from the structured reviews. Each rollout remains an independent `1 CPU / 4G / 55min` array task; fingerprinted batch journals and Plan/Code/Evaluator/Reviewer checkpoints support selective retry. |
| `online_gepa_supervisor.yaml` | Local tmux+caffeinate | Exact formal launch identity: session/log, 8-iteration target, 30-minute cadence, unlimited controller slices, remote workdir, and `1 CPU / 4G / 2h` controller arguments. Use this file instead of reconstructing a long command. |
| `gepa_online_planning_pilot.yaml` | local Docker | Standard small executable example for validating the Online GEPA flow locally. |

Online GEPA is the current mainline. Candidate rules go only to the Plan Agent;
Code receives the issue and generated plan, and Reflection receives evidence
created by the current rollout.

Code may write diagnostic tests in its isolated workspace and is responsible
for staging the final submission it wants the clean official evaluator to run.
The Host requires a formal non-empty submission and preserves its bytes across
checkpoint/worker transfer, but does not filter paths or repair the patch.
Malformed, incomplete, or poorly selected patches are evaluator-visible Code
outcomes and normally score unresolved rather than blocking the run.

The SIF instance reviewer may also run focused tests or make temporary
diagnostic/counterfactual edits after inspecting the untouched base. These edits
are discarded with its SIF overlay; repository actions and observations remain
in the reviewer trajectory and structured review for synthesis.

The runtime config and launch config have separate authority: changing prompts,
budgets, evaluator, or worker resources belongs in
`gepa_online_planning_hpc.yaml`; changing the run identity, iteration target,
poll cadence, controller resources, or remote workdir belongs in
`online_gepa_supervisor.yaml`. Keep their run identity and job prefix aligned.

## Representative Paused Workflows

| Config | Historical workflow represented |
|---|---|
| `gepa_verified_rules.yaml` | Offline GEPA strict Checker optimization. |
| `polybench_full199_pct.yaml` | PCT/PCC-era PolyBench data collection and checker evaluation. |
| `analysis_kimi_opencode.yaml` | Per-case rule extraction/aggregation analysis. |
| `gepa_initial_rules_gpt_seed.md` | Shared immutable seed used by representative GEPA configs. |

## Archive

| Directory | Contents |
|---|---|
| `archive/online_tests/` | Date-specific Online GEPA smoke, resource pilot, and invalid resume configs. |
| `archive/offline_gepa/` | Offline GEPA pilots, smoke tests, alternate runtimes, and superseded rule seeds. |
| `archive/pct_runs/` | PCT continuation, completion, and retry manifests/configs. |
| `archive/gepa_legacy/` | Earlier superseded offline GEPA configuration. |

Archived configs are intentionally executable for reproduction, but they are
not defaults and should not be copied into a new experiment without reviewing
their output path and historical failure context.

## Model Safety

Current GEPA rule-optimization configs should use `deepseek-v4-flash` for both
Checker and Reflection. Do not add `deepseek-v4-pro`, Kimi, or other providers
to GEPA configs unless the experiment explicitly requires it and the run plan
documents why.
